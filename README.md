OMG dude, okay, so just finished Mountainhead and like... what even was that?! I mean, it’s one of those  s where you’re just staring at the screen like “Is this for real?” But then BAM, it hits you with such intense feels. You get me? I’m kinda reeling here. 

And the visuals, holy crap. I mean, how often do you 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 a   where the mountains almost look like they’re gonna swallow you whole? 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   if you haven’t already man, it’s a wild ride. Feels like hiking on an emotional roller coaster. 

Also, let's talk characters. The main guy, forget his name, let's call him Bob for lack of brain cells right now, ugh. He’s like, annoyingly relatable, you know? One second you wanna slap some sense into him, and the next he pulls this insane self-reflective move, and you’re like, “Okay Bob, you win.” I swear I laughed more at the   than I did at that comedy special we saw last week. 

> And seriously, that girl, the one in the red hat? Total mystery. Like, does she even have a backstory? I couldn’t tell. But she just kinda makes sense by not making sense, ya know? It’s like when you open the fridge and just stare, expecting something magical to appear. Don’t ask me why I said that. 

Oh man, remember to 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   and tell me what you think. It had its lulls, like all  s do, but those peaks made it worth it. Or maybe my brain's just fried... probably a bit of both. 

auto x = 42; // No clue why I typed this, my head's spun around.

Honestly, I’m just here chilling, processing, and maybe rambling a bit. Let me know if you want more deets or wanna rant too. Catch you later!
